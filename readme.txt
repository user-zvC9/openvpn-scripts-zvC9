You have 3 machines: CA, client, server.
Can be CA=server or CA=client.
Can NOT be client=server.

Note: where you are going to type "${netname}", type value of variable "netname", which
you have set in "bashlib/openvpn-openssl-vars.bash". If it's set to "mytestnet1",
string "${netname}" becomes "mytestnet1".

What to do:
0. Edit "bashlib/openvpn-openssl-vars.bash"
1. On client and on server launch  "generate-openvpn-configs.bash"
2. On client launch "client-generate-openvpn-client-key-and-CSR.bash"
3. On server launch "server-generate-openvpn-server-key-and-CSR-and-dhparam.bash"
4. On CA, launch "CA-generate-openvpn-CAkey.bash"
5. copy from client "created_files_for_use/client/generated/${netname}/${netname}-tls-client.csr.pem" into same directory on CA
6. copy from server "created_files_for_use/server/generated/${netname}/${netname}-tls-server.csr.pem" into same directory on CA
7. launch "CA-sign-CSRs.bash" on CA
8. from CA copy file "created_files_for_use/client/generated/${netname}/${netname}-tls-client.ca-signed.cert.pem" to same directory on client
9. from CA copy file "created_files_for_use/server/generated/${netname}/${netname}-tls-server.ca-signed.cert.pem" to same directory on server
10. On server, copy "created_files_for_use/server/generated/${netname}" into "/etc/openvpn/generated/"
11. On server, copy "created_files_for_use/server/${netname}-tls-server.conf" into "/etc/openvpn/"
12. On client, copy "created_files_for_use/client/generated/${netname}" into "/etc/openvpn/generated/"
13. On client, copy "created_files_for_use/client/${netname}-tls-client.conf" into "/etc/openvpn/"
14. On server, if you are using systemd init system, run in bash as root "systemctl enable openvpn@${netname}-tls-server",
  where var "netname" has value which you configured in "bashlib/openvpn-openssl-vars.bas"
Note: you can run "source bashlib/openvpn-openssl-vars.bas" in bash to get variables set
15. On client, if you are using systemd init system, run in bash as root "systemctl enable openvpn@${netname}-tls-client",
  where var "netname" has value which you configured in "bashlib/openvpn-openssl-vars.bas"
Note: you can run "source bashlib/openvpn-openssl-vars.bas" in bash to get variables set
16. If you are using non-systemd init system, find other way to configure openvpn to start on boot.
17. Reboot to launch openvpn or use terminal to launch it (with systemd can do this: "systemctl start openvpn@${netname}-tls-server" on server,
  "systemctl start openvpn@${netname}-tls-client" on client. Before running set "netname" variable as it is set in "bashlib/openvpn-openssl-vars.bash")

Note: can manually launch openvpn this way:
  server: "openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/${netname}-tls-server.conf",
  client: "openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/${netname}-tls-client.conf",
 don't forget to set "netname" variable as it is set in "bashlib/openvpn-openssl-vars.bash"
